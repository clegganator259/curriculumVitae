\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{July 2015 -- July 2016 }{Software Associate at Accenture}{ }{}{}{
At Accenture I worked as a consultant on 3 different projects: As a tester for a telecom company, as a financial analyst at a tobbaco firm and as a developer working on the Accenture development pipeline. Along side this I was also responsible for creating a game to demonstrate how resistant Accenture's services were to server outages. This was the centre piece of the Accenture's stall at the DevOps days conference. During this year I learnt to be highly flexible and to pick up new things very quickly. I also learnt how to work in a team both locally and internationally, having to liase with offices in every timezone.

\cventry{July 2014 -- August 2014 }{Student Intern on ChemAccess project for two of my lecturers}{ }{}{}{
Completely redesigned the ChemAccess website and then wrote the classes which identified functional groups in chemical equations. The system was designed to make chemical diagrams written in textbooks more accessible to visually impaired students. My classes were used to assist the parsing of the molecule so it could be more intuitively presented. I had  to quickly get to grips with a large existing codebase and follow the existing code's conventions to ensure readability.

\section{Interests}

\cventry{}{Martial Arts}{}{}{}
{
	I have done martial arts for 9 years, starting with Taekwondo for 8 years and, since I moved to University,  Muay Thai (Thai Boxing).

{
	In \textbf{2011} I went to Ukraine to work in an orphanage in Kiev and then spend 5 days trekking in Crimea. I also have been on numerous treks in the Breacon Beacons and in Snowdonia. As well the physical challenges I enjoy the logistical challenges of having to pack everything you need for a 5 day expedition on your back as it brings the interesting compromise of weight vs kit you might need.
