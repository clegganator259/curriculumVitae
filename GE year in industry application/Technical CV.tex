\section{Work Experience}
 
\cventry{July 2014 -- August 2014 }{Student Intern on ChemAccess project for two of my lecturers}{ }{}{}{
Completely redesigned the ChemAccess website and wrote the classes which identified functional groups in chemical equations. The system was designed to make chemical diagrams written in textbooks more accessible to visually impaired students. My classes were used to assist the parsing of the molecule so it could be more intuitively presented. I had  to quickly get accustomed to a large existing codebase and follow the existing code's conventions to ensure readability.

{
	In \textbf{2011} I went to Ukraine to work in an orphanage in Kiev and then spend 5 days trekking in Crimea. I also have been on numerous treks in the Breacon Beacons and in Snowdonia. As well the physical challenges I enjoy the logistical challenges of having to pack everything you need for a 5 day expedition on your back as it brings the interesting compromise of weight vs kit you might need.
}

\cventry{}{``Tinkering''}{}{}{}
{
	Technology has always fascinated me and I am currently working on converting a Raspberry Pi into a retro games console.
